# üß† Fake Job Posting Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

## üìå Overview
This project aims to automatically detect **fraudulent job advertisements** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.  
Fake job postings have become a growing threat, often used for phishing or financial scams.  
The project compares two models ‚Äî **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** ‚Äî to determine which performs better in identifying suspicious job postings.  

The final solution is deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to paste or upload job descriptions and instantly check whether they appear *real* or *fake*.

## üìÇ Dataset Source
The dataset used is derived from the **Employment Scam Aegean Dataset (EMSCAD)**, a popular benchmark for job fraud detection tasks.  
Additionally, a **synthetic labeled dataset (1,000 samples)** was created to evaluate and visualize model performance more effectively.

### Dataset Summary
| Property | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| Training samples | ~18,000 |
| Test samples | 1,000 |
| Features | `title`, `company_profile`, `description`, `requirements`, `benefits` |
| Target variable | `fraudulent` ‚Üí 0 = Real, 1 = Fake |

### Preprocessing Steps
1. Removed missing and duplicate text entries  
2. Combined multiple textual columns into a single feature (`text`)  
3. Converted text to lowercase and removed punctuation  
4. Transformed text into numeric vectors using **TF-IDF Vectorization**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods

The overall process is based on text classification using two pipelines ‚Äî **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** ‚Äî built with **scikit-learn**.

### üß© Workflow
Raw Data ‚Üí Cleaning ‚Üí TF-IDF Vectorization ‚Üí ML Model (LR / RF) ‚Üí Evaluation
### Model Details
| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Feature Engineering** | TF-IDF to represent text numerically |
| **Model 1** | Logistic Regression (interpretable and fast) |
| **Model 2** | Random Forest (handles feature interactions) |
| **Evaluation Metrics** | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix |
| **Visualization Tools** | Matplotlib and Seaborn |

### Why These Models?
- **Logistic Regression** offers strong performance on sparse TF-IDF data and is easy to interpret.  
- **Random Forest** captures non-linear patterns and works well when features interact in complex ways.  

Alternative algorithms such as SVMs or XGBoost were considered but not included to keep the focus on interpretability and efficiency.
